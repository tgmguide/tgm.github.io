I"É<p>This guide will tell you how to get Texmaster2009 running.
Normally, we‚Äôd tell you to check out the introductory guide, but unfortunately, we haven‚Äôt gotten around to updating the TL;DR for it juuust yet.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the steps we‚Äôre taking on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Downloading Texmaster2009-5</li>
  <li>Seting up Texmaster properly</li>
  <li>OPTIONAL: Seting up ‚ÄúTermino Velocity‚Äù, a custom theme</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="downloading-texmaster2009-5">Downloading Texmaster2009-5</h2>

<p>First thing you need is Texmaster itself, of course. The link for that can be <a href="http://mindflyer.net/tetris/texmaster/Texmaster2009-5.7z">Right about here.</a> You‚Äôll need 7-Zip to unpack the archive. If you don‚Äôt have it yet, use your mighty Google powers and find any mirror to download it from. (TODO link 7-Zip website) Just unzip it anywhere and you will end up with a folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Texmaster2009</code>. Enter that folder - You should see something like this.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/texysetup/rootfolder.png" alt="Texmaster folder, fully extracted" /></p>

<p>From here on out, this place will be referred to as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> folder in the guide.</p>

<p>Technically, Texmaster is already ready to go, albeit with a bit of a cramped layout.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Assuming you have a QWERTY keyboard:
P1 Up          - S
P1 Down        - X
P1 Left        - Z
P1 Right       - C
P1 Button 1    - N
P1 Button 2    - M
P1 Button 3    - ,
P1 Button 4    - Spacebar
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-texmaster-properly">Setting up Texmaster properly</h2>

<p>However, of course, we can remedy this, thanks to the wonderful <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Texmaster2009.ini</code> file we can see in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> folder. Open it up in a text editor of your choice - if you don‚Äôt have one yet, we recommend you to give Notepad++ a try!</p>

<p>Now, once in here, there‚Äôs a bunch of variables you can change. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[VIDEO]</code> settings, I recommend you to only change the resolution and whether you want to use fullscreen or not. The other options are a bit more advanced and don‚Äôt really matter anyways.</p>

<p class="message">
 Take note that if you want to change the resolution, you should always work with whole numbers, multiplying the base resolution of <b>320x240</b>! Using any other resolution will make your game look very weird. For example, sinefuse, the guide maintainer, uses 1280x960 (which is 4 times the base resolution), so they've set the width to 1280 and the height to 960.
</p>

<p>The part that‚Äôs more important to us is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[KEYBOARD]</code> settings, which you can find when scrolling down a bit. This only applies if you do not want to use the base key layout.</p>
