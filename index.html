<span style="font-size: 4em;">TETRIS TGM SETUP GUIDE</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 2em;">A handy guide on how to set up TGM and Texmaster</span>
<br><br>
[Non-TL;DR Guides to follow!]<br>
<div class="box2">
	<b style="font-size: 2em;">TL;DR BELOW</b>
	<br>
	<b style="font-size: 1.5em;">TGM1/TAP</b><br>
	Install shmupmame first: 
    <a href="https://shmupmame.wordpress.com/download/">[download]</a><br>
	Then paste mametgm into the shmupmame folder: 
    <a href="https://github.com/sanford1/shmupmametgm/releases">[download]</a><br>
	<br>
	Now you'll need roms. This guide cannot hook you up with those due to legal reasons but the filenames you're
    looking for are as follows:<br>
	TGM1: "tgmj.zip" and "cpzn2.zip". If you decide to not use shmupmametgm for whatever reason and want to run
    the regular newest MAME version for whatever reason, you'll also need "qsound.zip".<br>
	TGM2/TAP: "tgm2.zip" and "tgm2p.zip". Keep in mind you MUST start "tgm2p.zip" if you want to play the TAP
    exclusive modes such as T.A. Death.<br>
    By the way, I heard that there may be a website which declares itself as a paradise which has these. ;)<br>
	To change key layout, press Tab and navigate with WASD and H to enter menus. Then set the keys to whatever
    you like.<br>
	<br>
	<b style="font-size: 1.5em;">TGM3 Terror Instinct</b><br>
    First you'll need to go on a small scavenger hunt for the actual game files. Doing a google search for it
    should usually do the job.<br>
	Now, you absolutely MUST download the altinput package unless you want stupid amounts of input lag: 
    <a href="http://tgmguide.github.io/altinput.zip">[download]</a><br>
	To configure your keyboard layout, you need to open the cfg that comes with altinput and check out the
    link to a Microsoft page that's in there. Then do some ctrl-F searching for the keys you need and paste the
    according codes into the cfg file.<br>
	When starting the game, <span style="color:#97FFF0;">start it using tgm3_launcher.exe!</span> Don't use the normal launcher!<br>
	If you've done everything correctly then you too can now enjoy all of these games!<br><br>
    
	<b style="font-size: 1.5em;">Texmaster</b><br>
	But <b>WAIT!</b> I don't like piracy, it's unethical! HOW DO I CIRCUMVENT THIS?<br>
	Well, lucky you! We have Texmaster! A free clone with which you can play all TGM modes (aside from Sakura
    from TGM3)!<br>
    <span style="color:#97FFF0;">Note: for all downloads in this section, you need 7-Zip! Go google it up or something.</span><br>
	Here is the download link to the latest Texmaster version: 
    <a href="http://mindflyer.net/tetris/texmaster/Texmaster2009-5.7z">[download]</a><br>
	But man, regular Texmaster looks like shit. Let's fix this, shall we?<br>
	Grab this "modpack" called Termino Velocity! It absolutely kicks vanilla Texmaster's ass with an
    entirely new look and feel to it. Download's here: <a href="http://csr.s-ul.eu/0Qap4I3F.7z">[download]</a><br>
	In order to change your key layout, open the .ini and then the "keys.html" file in the "html" folder to see
    which numbers you need to use for the individual keys. Don't forget to set Player 1's key layout to your
    custom one.
    <br>
	<br>
	And there you go. A quick TL;DR (which is still fairly long) to just get the games up and running.<br>
	Now go out there and stack to your hearts content!
