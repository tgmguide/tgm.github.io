# tgmguide-jekyll
A guide for TGM, built with Jekyll (using a somewhat-heavily modified version of the Lanyon theme)

This guide is based on [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) (with slight modifications to the CSS and the template pages), which in turn is a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Licensed under the MIT license, as Lanyon also is licensed under the same license.

Articles can be written by anybody, as this is an open-source project. I will however take responsibility of renaming files in ways that makes the main page look organized (TGM1 > TAP > Ti > Clones, alphabetically).

## How do I run this?

Download the repo and put its files into a folder named "tgmguide" (very important), open cmd, cd into the repo folder you have and run `jekyll serve`. from here on you can edit the markdown files and preview them on `localhost:4000`.
