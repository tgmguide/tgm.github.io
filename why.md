title: About the guide

This guide exists so new TGM players can jump into the game quickly, without much hassle. With the game being obscure enough as is and PCB prices going up constantly, it's getting harder and harder to have a proper solution for playing these fantastic games.

In case you find any problems with the content of this website, please contact me on my Twitter account, which is [@sinefuse](https://twitter.com/sinefuse) and I will respond as soon as I can.

This guide is based on [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) (with slight modifications to the CSS and the template pages), which in turn is a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The source code for this guide is available [in this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/sinewaveslicer/tgmguide-jekyll)
